## Simple Movie Site With React

### Updates - Update To v1.0.0

Complete design change. This version contains an entire user layout design change with the utilisation of CSS Grid and flexbox layouts

#### Overview

In this application, I use React to get data from The Movie DB api. Using axios, I fetch the data and display to my homepage. The homepage contains multiple components to display data. At the top most is the NowShowing data displaying movies shown in theatres in a bootstrap carousel.
The second section contains TodayTrending movies and the third section contains popular movies based on The Movie DB's database. With this simple application, I have created my first ever application using React.
