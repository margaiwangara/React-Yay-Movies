<h3>Simple Movie Site With React</h3>
<p>
In this application, I use React to get data from The Movie DB api. Using axios, I fetch the data and display to my homepage. The homepage contains multiple components to display data. At the top most is the NowShowing data displaying movies shown in theatres in a bootstrap carousel.
The second section contains TodayTrending movies and the third section contains popular movies based on The Movie DB's database. With this simple application, I have created my first ever application using React.
